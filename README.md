# Anti NPC Theme

This is a simple vscode theme with very bright green colours. 
It's called "Anti NPC Theme" because it's meant to wake you up to reality and is only usable if you're not an NPC.

This whole thing was made for jokes but can be used in a serious manner.

## General Info

I will update this in the future to actual be more usable for the avarage person but for now this is the way it will stay.
